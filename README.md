# Guides

The following paragraphs explain how to run the miner-application and the wallet app

## Udocoin Miner

### Docker/docker-compose

To run the udocoin miner application, with Docker you need to have Docker Desktop and docker-compose installed on your machine. 

If you don't have a public and a private key, you also need to have at least python 3.8 to generate keys. (See References for testing keys)

In your terminal, change your directory to udocoin/udocoin_miner

```sh
cd udocoin_miner
```

Execute the start files and follow the instructions in the terminal.

Windows:
```sh
start.ps1
```

Other operating systems:
```sh
source start.sh
```

Building the docker containers will take some time. Keep in mind to have the Docker Desktop app running while building the application.

The server will be running on [localhost:80](http://localhost).

### Without Docker

To run the udocoin miner application without Docker, you need to have at least python 3.8 installed.

Change the directory to udocoin/udocoin_miner/application

```sh
cd udocoin_miner/application
```

Create and activate a python virtual environment and install required packages

Windows:

```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Other operation systems:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And then start the server

Windows:

```sh
python run.py
```

Other operating systems:

```sh
python3 run.py
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal and the server will be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
